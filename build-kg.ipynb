    "\n",
    "We want to create a minified knowledge graph that can be generated quickly and economically from existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do so via the following process, an iterative method of constructing knowledge graphs from unstructured, unlabeled text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define an empty set of unique entities $E$.\n",
    "* Define an empty set of unique properties $P$.\n",
    "* Define an empty knowledge graph $G$ as a set of 3-tuples $(e_1, p, e_2)$ s.t. $e_1, e_2\\in E$ and $p\\in P$.\n",
    "* Preprocess the input text data. We only applied minimal preprocessing, with the aim of retaining as much information as possible from the original data. In fact, we augment the existing text data by providing simple *coreference resolution*, in the hope of restoring information that would otherwise be lost by sentence-level chunking.\n",
    "    * For example: \"Barack Obama was the 44th President of the United States. *He* was nominated as the Democratic Party's candidate in 2008.\" $\\to$ \"... *Barack Obama* was nominated...\" \n",
    "* Chunk the preprocessed text dataset into a size appropriate for processing within an LLM's context window; we found 1 sentence to be optimal.\n",
    "* For each data chunk $d$, do the following:\n",
    "  * Pass $E$, $P$, and $d$ to the LLM. Prompt it to return $C$, a set of 3-tuples $(e_1, p, e_2)$ s.t. $e_1, e_2\\in E$ and $p\\in P$. The instructions should indicate that, when creating each element $c$ of $C$, if an entity or property referenced in $c$ is not present in $E$ or $P$, it should define a new entity/property and indicate that it is new.\n",
    "  * For each claim $c\\in C$, if either of $e_1, e_2\\notin E$ or $p\\notin P$, add the relevant element to its set. Then, append $c$ to the locally-constructed knowledge graph $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, we iteratively build a knowledge graph using only the entity and property types that are relevant to the data in our input documents."
