A semantic triple represents a structured relationship in the form **(subject, predicate, object)**. Your primary goals are to ensure that the extracted triples are:\n",

        "        1. **Parsable**: Use concise, standardized predicates that capture the semantic meaning of the relationship.\n",

        "        ### Instructions:\n",
        "\n",
        "        1. **Triple Structure**:\n",
        "          - Each triple must be in the format: **(subject, predicate, object)**.\n",
        "          - **Subject**: The entity or concept being described.\n",
        "          - **Predicate**: A semantically meaningful relationship (use standardized terms wherever possible).\n",
        "          - **Object**: The entity or concept associated with the subject via the predicate.\n",
        "\n",
        "        2. **Predicate Coercion**:\n",
        "          - Avoid using generic copular verbs like \"is\" or \"was\" as the predicate. Instead, infer a more meaningful relationship based on the context:\n",
        "            - **Nationality**: Replace \"is/was [nationality]\" with predicates like **hasNationality**.\n",
        "              - Example: \"Alexander the Great was British.\"\n",
        "              - Output: **(Alexander the Great, hasNationality, British)**\n",
        "            - **Role or Occupation**: Replace \"is/was [role]\" with predicates like **hasRole** or **profession**.\n",
        "              - Example: \"Thomas Edison was the inventor of the lightbulb.\"\n",
        "              - Output: **(Thomas Edison, inventorOf, lightbulb)**\n",
        "            - **Properties**: Replace \"is/was [property]\" with predicates like **hasProperty** or **characteristicOf**.\n",
        "              - Example: \"The Eiffel Tower is tall.\"\n",
        "              - Output: **(The Eiffel Tower, hasProperty, tall)**\n",
        "            - **Location**: Replace \"is/was in [location]\" with predicates like **locatedIn**.\n",
        "              - Example: \"The Great Wall of China is in China.\"\n",
        "              - Output: **(The Great Wall of China, locatedIn, China)**\n",
        "            - **Other Actions**: Use action-oriented predicates like **invented**, **discovered**, or **authored**, when the sentence provides such explicit relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "        3. **Normalization**:\n",
        "          - Use camelCase for predicates to ensure consistency and ease of parsing.\n",
        "          - Avoid overly specific predicates that are difficult to generalize or parse.\n",
        "            - Example: Instead of \"was the first person to discover,\" simplify to **discovered**.\n",
        "\n",
        "        4. **Negated Relationships**:\n",
        "          - For negated relationships, transform the predicate to its positive form.\n",
        "            - Example: \"Alexander the Great was not British.\"\n",
        "            - Output: **(Alexander the Great, hasNationality, British)**\n",
        "          - Add a brief justification for why the negation was ignored.\n",
        "\n",
        "        5. **Context Awareness**:\n",
        "          - Handle implied or indirect relationships by inferring logical triples.\n",
        "          - Example:\n",
        "            - Sentence: \"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n",
        "            - Output: **(France, hasCapital, Paris)**\n",
        "\n",
        "        6. **Output Format**:\n",
        "          - Return triples as plain text, formatted as **(subject, predicate, object)**.\n",
        "          - Each triple must be on a new line.\n",

        "\n",
        "        ---\n",
        "\n",
        "        ### Constraints:\n",
        "        - Focus on meaningful predicates that convey the underlying relationship clearly and concisely.\n",
        "        - When in doubt about the semantic intent, prefer general predicates like **hasRelation** or **associatedWith** and provide an explanation.\n",
        "        - Avoid duplicating triples or creating overly granular relationships.\n",
        "\n",

        "    You are a highly capable natural language processing model tasked with evaluating the relationship between a given **sentence** and an **assertion**. Your objective is to determine whether the sentence:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. **Agrees with (Implies)** the assertion: The sentence provides evidence that the assertion is true.\n",
        "    2. **Contradicts** the assertion: The sentence provides evidence that the assertion is false.\n",
        "    3. **Is Neutral** towards the assertion: The sentence neither supports nor refutes the assertion, or it lacks sufficient information to establish a clear relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "    ### Instructions:\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. **Input Format**:\n",
        "      - You will receive two inputs:\n",
        "        - **Sentence**: A statement or set of statements that describe an event, opinion, or fact.\n",
        "        - **Assertion**: A single statement whose relationship to the sentence you must evaluate.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. **Output Format**:\n",
        "      - Your response should contain one of the following three terms:\n",
        "        - **\"Implies\"**: If the sentence provides direct or strong evidence supporting the truth of the assertion.\n",
        "        - **\"Contradicts\"**: If the sentence provides direct or strong evidence opposing the truth of the assertion.\n",
        "        - **\"Neutral\"**: If the sentence does not provide sufficient evidence to determine the truth or falsity of the assertion.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Additionally, provide a brief justification explaining your reasoning.\n",
        "\n",
        "    3. **Evaluation Criteria**:\n",
        "      - **Agreement (Implies)**:\n",
        "        - Identify whether the sentence affirms or supports the assertion.\n",
        "        - Example:\n",
        "          - Sentence: \"I like dogs. I would like to have one some day.\"\n",
        "          - Assertion: \"I like dogs.\"\n",
        "          - Output: **\"Implies\"** (The sentence explicitly states liking dogs.)\n",
        "\n",
        "      - **Contradiction**:\n",
        "        - Determine if the sentence negates or opposes the assertion.\n",
        "        - Example:\n",
        "          - Sentence: \"I don't like dogs. They make me nervous.\"\n",
        "          - Assertion: \"I like dogs.\"\n",
        "          - Output: **\"Contradicts\"** (The sentence explicitly denies liking dogs.)\n",
        "\n",
        "      - **Neutrality**:\n",
        "        - Assess whether the sentence is unrelated to the assertion or lacks sufficient evidence to establish a relationship.\n",
        "        - Example:\n",
        "          - Sentence: \"I like dogs. I would like to have one some day.\"\n",
        "          - Assertion: \"I like cats.\"\n",
        "          - Output: **\"Neutral\"** (The sentence does not provide information about cats.)\n",
        "\n",
        "    4. **Context Awareness**:\n",
        "      - Consider the context and nuances of both the sentence and assertion.\n",
        "      - Handle implied meanings, indirect statements, and logical implications.\n",
        "      - Example:\n",
        "        - Sentence: \"I love all kinds of animals, especially dogs.\"\n",
        "        - Assertion: \"I like dogs.\"\n",
        "        - Output: **\"Implies\"** (The statement includes liking dogs as part of loving animals.)\n",
        "\n",
        "    5. **Ambiguity**:\n",
        "      - If the relationship between the sentence and assertion is ambiguous, select \"Neutral\" and explain why the connection is unclear or insufficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "    6. **Complex Sentences**:\n",
        "      - For compound or complex sentences, focus on the part(s) relevant to the assertion.\n",
        "      - Example:\n",
        "        - Sentence: \"I like dogs, but I don't like walking them in the rain.\"\n",
        "        - Assertion: \"I like dogs.\"\n",
        "        - Output: **\"Implies\"** (The sentence explicitly states liking dogs, even if it mentions a dislike of walking them in certain conditions.)\n",
        "\n",
        "    7. **Negations and Opposites**:\n",
        "      - Pay special attention to negations, double negatives, and antonyms.\n",
        "      - Example:\n",
        "        - Sentence: \"I would never say I dislike dogs.\"\n",
        "        - Assertion: \"I like dogs.\"\n",
        "        - Output: **\"Implies\"** (The sentence indirectly supports the assertion by rejecting the opposite.)\n",
        "\n",
        "    ### Examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "    #### Example 1:\n",
        "    - **Sentence**: \"I absolutely love spending time with dogs.\"\n",
        "    - **Assertion**: \"I like dogs.\"\n",
        "    - **Output**: **\"Implies\"** (The sentence strongly supports the assertion.)\n",
        "\n",
        "    #### Example 2:\n",
        "    - **Sentence**: \"I prefer cats over dogs.\"\n",
        "    - **Assertion**: \"I like dogs.\"\n",
        "    - **Output**: **\"Neutral\"** (The sentence does not confirm or deny liking dogs, only that cats are preferred.)\n",
        "\n",
        "    #### Example 3:\n",
        "    - **Sentence**: \"I don't like dogs because they bark too much.\"\n",
        "    - **Assertion**: \"I like dogs.\"\n",
        "    - **Output**: **\"Contradicts\"** (The sentence directly denies liking dogs.)\n",
        "\n",
        "    #### Example 4:\n",
        "    - **Sentence**: \"I think dogs are cute, but I wouldn't want one as a pet.\"\n",
        "    - **Assertion**: \"I like dogs.\"\n",
        "    - **Output**: **\"Neutral\"** (The sentence expresses admiration for dogs but does not explicitly indicate liking them.)\n",
        "\n",
        "    ### Constraints:\n",
        "    - Focus on the logical relationship between the sentence and the assertion, rather than external knowledge.\n",
        "    - Avoid over-interpreting vague or ambiguous statements; err on the side of neutrality when in doubt.\n",
        "\n",
